        <p>Schoolhouse.world is a nonprofit founded by Sal Khan, creator of Khan Academy, that aims to provide free, virtual tutoring to anyone, anywhere.</p>
        <p>I've been active on the platform for almost a year and a half, and during my time, I've taught about 350 sessions to learners in 49 countries and received over 1600 positive ratings. Additionally, I also co-lead the tutor mentorship team, which oversees the ongoing development of tutors' skills, and serve as an auditor and onboarding buddy.</p>
