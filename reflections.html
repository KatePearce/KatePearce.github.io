          University of Arkansas Visit
        </h2>


        <p>I recently had the opportunity to visit the University of Arkansas's College of Engineering and tour the facilities with passionate students and faculty. Overall, the trip was very insightful! I enjoyed seeing the variety of projects throughout the college, especially in the computer science department. The university has a diverse array of makerspaces and similar workspaces where students can utilize their creativity and work on passion projects. I also had the opportunity to listen to a short lecture on quantum computing and learn about circuits using Play-Doh! Both instructors were very engaging, and, overall, I learned a lot about the university and its engineering innovations.</p>
