      An Intelligent Tutoring System to Predict Learning Styles: MIT THINK Scholars Program
    </h2>



      <p>In January 2021, my proposal to develop an intelligent tutoring system that would not only predict student knowledge states, but also their learning preferences, was one of six out of over four hundred proposals selected as a finalist in the MIT THINK competition.</p>

      <p>Throughout the spring semester, I collaborated with MIT students and faculty to bring my idea to life and fleshing out four main modules: the student model, which determines what a student does and doesn't know; the domain model, which holds the mathematical knowledge of the system; the tutor model, which determines how to teach content to the student; and the user interface model, which provides the connection between student and ITS.</p>
